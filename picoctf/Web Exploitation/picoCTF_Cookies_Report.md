## Solution:

This challenge belongs to the **Web Exploitation** category from **picoCTF 2021**.  
The goal is to identify the ‚Äúbest‚Äù cookie and use it to reveal the flag.

1. **Opened the challenge link**:  
   When visiting the given URL, we get a simple web page with a ‚Äúflag‚Äù placeholder or login-like behavior.

2. **Checked browser cookies**:  
   - Opened **Developer Tools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies** tab.  
   - Observed a cookie named something like `name` or `user`, having integer values (e.g., 0, 1, 2...).

3. **Modified the cookie manually**:  
   - Changed the cookie‚Äôs value incrementally and refreshed the page each time.  
   - Each cookie value displayed a different response message.

4. **Found the correct cookie value**:  
   - After testing multiple values, one of them displayed the flag on the web page.

## Flag:

```

## Concepts learnt:

- **Cookies in Web Applications:**  
  Cookies store small pieces of data in browsers, which can include authentication or user role info.

- **Cookie Manipulation:**  
  By modifying cookie values, you can sometimes access different content or privilege levels.

- **Client-Side vs Server-Side Data:**  
  Client-side data (like cookies) can be tampered with, so secure sites must verify everything server-side.

## Notes:

- Initially thought the flag might be hidden in the HTML source, but it was actually controlled through cookie values.  
- Learning how to inspect and edit cookies in DevTools was key.  
- Alternate approach: automate cookie testing using Python‚Äôs `requests` library.
